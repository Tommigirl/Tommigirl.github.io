        <p> Hello Everyone! Everyone calls me the <em>Wet Bandit</em> and if you cant tell Im a Raccoon. I like to steal from others and savage trash. I cant help it but my attitude rubs off to everyone as If I am mad all the time, and Im tired of it. I have came to the conclusion I no longer want to be like this. I want to start my journey by just humbling myself to be a better raccoon.
